<h3>Before You Begin</h3>
		<div>Before you begin creating written and visual content for a website, ask yourself these questions:</div>
		<ul>
			<li>Who is your audience? Who are trying to reach with your message?</li>
			<li>What is your message? What are you trying to get across?</li>
			<li>What should happen after this message is delivered? What are your goals?</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Remember the Visitor has Come to Your Site for a Reason</h3>
		<div align="justify">
			Visitors have something they want to do when they come to your website. They are there either to do an action or to find information. It is your job to anticipate what they will want to do and help them to do it.
		</div>
		
		<h3>Your Visitor is in a Hurry</h3>
		<div align="justify">
			Time is valuable, and visitors to your website want to find what they are looking for and move on quickly. If they cannot do this, you risk losing them.
		</div>
		
		
		<h3>Most Visitors Scan Websites, They don't Read Every Word</h3>
		<div align="justify">
			Research shows that the majority of people scan Web copy, looking for key words or phrases. You must make your content conducive to scanning. That means breaking it into small, easily accessible and readable chunks. Headlines and subheads can further break up the content. Use bulleted lists instead of long, comma delimited lists.
		</div>
		
		
		<h3>Put the Important Content First</h3>
		<div align="justify">
			Don't bury your important information under several paragraphs of filler content. Keep top-level content simple and to the point and provide links to allow visitors to "drill down" to more specific items. Lead with your most important content, then elaborate. This will help your visitor find what they are looking for.
		</div>
		
		
		<h3>Use Links within Your Text</h3>
		<div align="justify">
			Incorporate your links within your text, rather than using phrases such as "click here" or "more." Having a sentence or a phrase as a link will make it clear to your visitor exactly what is going to happen when they click it.
		</div>
		
		
		<h3>Keep it Simple</h3>
		<div align="justify">
			The median reading level for an average American is the 8th grade. Also English is not the first language of many of our visitors. Finally, simple pages lend themselves to scanning. The following guidelines will help you help your visitors.
		</div>
		
		
		<h3>Proofread and Edit Your Copy</h3>
		<div align="justify">
			Check your facts and your spelling. Do not only rely on a computer spelling or grammar checker. Have somebody who is unfamiliar with your content check it for accuracy. It may be helpful to print your pages and proofread them away from the computer, as mistakes are often easier to find.
